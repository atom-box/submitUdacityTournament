What's going on here
----------------------
* This is a program to keep track of players during a Swiss-style tournament.
* This program was completed for the Udacity Relational Databases and Full Stack Fundamentals courses.  It was written by Evan Genest. 
* The main thing to check out is my python code in the file swissTournament/tournament.py. That Python code responds to the tests in the tournament_test.py file.
* Seven(!) views are generated by the program.  
I did that to maximize readability and ease of altering the details.
If I had to release this for use, I would condense these into just two views.

General Usage Notes
-----------------------
1.  Requires installing (a) PostgreSQL and (b) psycops2 package for Python
2.  Start by running the sql setup:     $psql tournament
3.  Then run: python tournament_test.py  This will call each of the functions in the tournament.py module.
